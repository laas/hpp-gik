2013-07-31, release 2.10
  * Do not take into account anchor joints when building weights with mask
  * Do not consider anchor joints when computing influencing dofs.
  * Fix rotation matrix to rotation vector conversion for small values.
  * Replace calls to updateTransformation by computeForwardKinematics.
  * Set default mask to whole-body mask when computing weights.

2012-02-07, release 2.9

  * Add parameter to both ChppGikSolver::solve methods:
    - parameter lambda is a multiplicative coefficient to apply to the
      configuration update. For backward compatibility, set parameter to 1.

2012-01-19, release 2.8
  * Add dependency to hpp-gik library in pkg-config file.
  * Add jrl-mal related headers for successful compilation of dependencies.
  * Update to comply with abstract-gik-task-2.6.
  * Fix a bug when using jrl-mathtools instead of t3d.
  * Add dependency to hpp-util for logging purposes.
  * Log height of foot at end of step.
  * Replace ankle CjrlJoint by CjrlFoot when possible
  * Fix computation of foot height in foot trajectory generation
  * Do not run test by default since they require extra dependencies.
  * Clean up:
    * remove unused function,
    * fix some warnings,
    * remove a strange semi-colon that anihilates test.
  * Before constructing a support polygon, check that feet are flat on
    the ground.
  * Add a pointer check to prevent the solver from segfaulting when locomotion
    planning has failed.
  * Bug fix: initialize variable before thresholding it.
  * Add interface for a zmp second pass filter based on preview controll
  * Rename Rodrigues computation function to be more explicit, fix small bug to
    correctly update the configuration when the free flyer dofs are not
    activated.
  * Add new constraint to fix the com x,y position relatively to a given joint.
  * Add missing include.
  * Add a constraint to fix the transformation of a joint relatively to another.
  * Fix computation of jacobians in relative transformation and com constraints
  * Use cmake submodule.
  * Enforce zero value for free flyer part of the jacobian of relative
    transformation.

New in 2.7.2, hpp-gik:

* Desctructor of ChppGikStandingRobot does not delete robot anymore.

New in 2.7.1, hpp-gik:

* Important bug fix in solver,
* export doxygendocdir variable in hpp-gik.pc.

New in 2.7, hpp-gik:

* Solvers have been rewritten to make computation faster,
* Changes in interface:
    1. ChppGikRobotTask::solutionMotion() now returns a non const reference to
       ChppRobotMotion,
    2. constructor of ChppGikStandingRobot now takes only a reference to a
       CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot as input parameters. The foot shapes are
       computed from information stored in this object.
       Old constructor is now deprecated,
    3. ChppGikFootDisplaceElement,
       ChppGikStandingRobot,
       ChppGikStepElement,
       ChppGikWalkElement,
       ChppGikZMPshiftElement  constructors take as first argument a pointer
       to ChppGikStandingRobot instead of a pointer to CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot.

New in 2.6.1, hpp-gik:
* Main page of documentation was not exported anymore in archive. This is fixed.

New in 2.6, hpp-gik:
* The package has been reorganized: names of files are now standard.
